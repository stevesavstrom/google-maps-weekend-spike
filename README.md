# Weekend Spike: Google Maps

In preparation for the Prime Solo Project, I am working on a weekend spike to learn a new feature that I will add to my application. I am learning more about the Google Maps API and how to create an interactive, searchable map with informational markers.

## Current Functionality
React App renders Google Map on DOM centered on Minneapolis. Maps through an array of locations and renders markers on the DOM.
